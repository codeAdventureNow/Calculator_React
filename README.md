# Calculator  
<br>
At the start of this project, I realized my JavaScript logic skills were limited. To level up, my mentor suggested building a vanilla JS calculator. I felt overwhelmed initially, but I decided to start with a simple HTML and CSS design to get things moving.
Step by step, I faced and conquered challenges along the way. One of my early wins was figuring out how to display numbers on the calculator's screen. It may seem small, but it was a significant milestone for me.
After completing the calculator in vanilla JS, I didn't stop there. I refactored it into React to improve functionality and maintainability. This decision paid off, giving me a deeper understanding of React's power.


## User Stories
&check;  The page must be fully responsive.
</br>
</br>
&check;  Each idea tile should contain a title and description, which is editable, as well as created/updated time.
</br>
</br>
&check;  New ideas should have the title field focused to prompt the user to begin typing.
</br>
</br>
&check;  Add the ability to sort ideas by creation date or alphabetically.


## Lessons Learned
- How to sort alphabetically and by date.

- Adding a character countdown.

- Conditional rendering based on if the user is editing a card.
